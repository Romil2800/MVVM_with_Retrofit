# MVVM_with_Retrofit
This is the app I built with Kotlin and Android Studio IDE. In this, I used other Android Architecture Components such as LiveData, ViewModels, Room, etc. I fetch the data from the https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/ API and load into the Room Database, so user can access it when the app is in Offline Mode.
